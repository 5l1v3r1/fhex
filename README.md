# Fhex - A Fucking HexEditor

This project is born with the aim to develop a lightweight, but useful tool. The reason is that the existing hex editors have some different limitations (e.g. too many dependencies, missing hex coloring features, etc.).

It is still under development, but actually it has the basic features to make it acceptable. 

This project is based on **qhexedit2**. New features should be added in the future, PRs are welcomed.
